- [x] Level JSON: tee, hole cup, rectangular walls; load at startup
- [x] Tune friction model (exponential damping) and stop epsilon
- [x] Post-Hole banner and simple “next hole” flow (single-hole for now)
- [x] Visual pass: retro palette, mustard table, inset fairway frame, light gray walls, subtle shading band
- [x] Terrain zones: water (penalty+reset), sand (higher friction), tuning pass (sand 4.2x)
- [x] Hills prototype: directional acceleration zones (visual gradient) per reference videos
- [x] Level 1: move flower decorations outside play area

## Level Editor & Browser — Completed
- [x] Level Editor UI: Menubar with File/Objects/Editor Tools menus (2025-01-10)
- [x] Level Editor Tool Palette: Initial tool palette UI (render buttons, hover cursor, click-to-select) (2025-01-10)
- [x] Level Editor Select Tool: moved from Objects to Editor Tools and renamed to 'Select Tool' (2025-01-10)
- [x] Level Editor Migration: completed migration of all editor code from `main.ts` to modular `levelEditor.ts` structure (2025-01-10); configurable grid size
  - [x] Refactor: delegated all Level Editor keyboard handling from `src/main.ts` to `levelEditor.handleKeyDown(editorEnv)`; removed legacy unreachable code referencing old globals in `main.ts`.
  - [x] Follow-up: run TypeScript check and do a manual smoke test of editor shortcuts, grid +/-/toggle, menu mnemonics, and Delete/nudge behaviors. (2025-08-22)
  - [x] Main Menu: add "Level Editor" entry to launch editor mode
  - [x] Multi-level persistence: Save, Save As, Load, New, Delete using local storage key `vp.levels.v1`; track current saved ID for overwrite semantics
  - [x] Preview rendering: fairway panel + outline, grid overlay, Tee/Cup markers
  - [x] Permissions: owner/admin-only overwrite and delete; non-owners are alerted and routed to "Save As"
  - [x] Migration: migrate legacy single-slot (`vp.editor.level`) into `vp.levels.v1` on first entry to the editor
  - [x] CRUD UI wiring: action buttons are part of `editorUiHotspots` and handled in Level Editor `mousedown`; hotspots rebuilt each frame
  - [x] Menu UI layering: draw menu panel/buttons last so they render above the grid; add semi-transparent panel background and border for readability
  - [x] Toolbar refactor: compact horizontal top toolbar (tools row + actions row incl. Back on right); hover/click unified via `editorUiHotspots`; editor preview renders beneath toolbar
  - [x] Editor preview: render existing geometry (water, sand, bridges, hills, decorations, walls, polygon walls, posts) using play-mode visuals
  - [x] Interactive placement: Posts (click); Walls/Bridges/Water/Sand/Hills (click-drag rectangles) with grid snapping, fairway clamping, and minimum drag threshold; crosshair cursor and drag state until mouseup
  - [x] Drag outline preview while dragging rectangle tools (grid-snapped, clamped to fairway bounds)
- [x] Polygon tools: implemented create/vertex-edit UI with click-to-add-vertex, Enter/Escape to finish/cancel, click-near-start to close (2025-08-22)
- [x] Hill direction control: implemented direction picker UI with N/S/E/W arrows (2025-08-22)
- [x] Post radius control: implemented radius picker UI with 6/8/10/12/16/20 options (2025-08-22)
- [x] Rotation: implemented for rectangular items with 15° snapping; shadow duplication fixed by removing legacy non-rotated shadows
- [x] Group rotation: multi-select rotates about the group bounds center; hold Shift to snap to 15°; snapshot original states at rotation start for accurate transforms
- [x] Polygon guards: polygons (wallsPoly/waterPoly/sandPoly) are translate-only; rotation/resize disabled; rotation handles hidden when any polygons are selected
- [x] Visual/UX: selection bounds cached each frame; multi-select bounds follow drag offset while moving; rotation state cleared on commit
- [x] Diagnosis resolved: included polygon variants in `findObjectAtPoint()` and `getObjectBounds()`; `moveSelectedObjects()` now translates polygon `points`; Delete key removes from poly arrays and `editorLevelData`; removed duplicate/incorrect implementations.
- [x] Consistency: defined local `COLORS` and `SelectableObject` in `src/editor/levelEditor.ts` and standardized naming to `wallsPoly` in `getObjectBounds()`.
- [x] Code refs (`src/main.ts`): `saveEditorLevel()`, `saveEditorLevelAs()`, `openLoadPicker()`, `openDeletePicker()`, `newEditorLevel()`, `assembleEditorLevel()`, Level Editor `mousedown`/`mousemove`/`mouseup`
- [x] Editor UI: Menubar with pull-down menus (replace compact toolbar)
  - File menu: New, Save, Save As, Level Load, Delete, Back/Exit
  - Objects menu: Tee, Cup, Post, Wall, WallsPoly, Bridge, Water, WaterPoly, Sand, SandPoly, Hill
  - Decorations menu: Flowers
  - Editor Tools menu: Select Tool, Grid -, Grid +, Grid On/Off
  - Hotspots & rendering: build dropdowns into `editorUiHotspots`; manage open/close state, hover, and click routing; keyboard navigation for menus/items
  - Layout: top menubar with pull-down panels; render above preview; ensure readability and spacing; maintain current preview layering
  - Shortcuts: preserve existing shortcuts (G, -, +); mnemonics (Alt+F/O/D/E) and arrow navigation
  - Docs: update `PROGRESS.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` upon implementing
  - Tests: hover/click open-close behavior; action dispatch correctness
- [x] Menubar tweak: move 'Select' tool from Objects to 'Editor Tools' menu and rename label to 'Select Tool' in code/UI
- [x] Select Tool implementation
  - Hit-testing and object bounds detection for all level objects (tee, cup, posts, walls, water, sand, bridges, decorations, hills)
  - Single-click selection with visual bounding outlines and handles
  - Multi-select with Ctrl/Shift + click to add/remove from selection
  - Selection box drag to select multiple objects within rectangular area
  - Move selected objects with mouse drag (grid-snapped, bounds-clamped)
  - Arrow key movement for selected objects (respects grid size)
  - Delete key to remove selected objects (preserves tee/cup as required elements)
  - 8-point resize handles for rectangular objects (walls, water, sand, bridges, hills)
  - Grid-snapped resize with minimum size constraints and fairway bounds clamping
  - 4-point rotation handles for rectangular objects with 15-degree angle snapping
  - Visual feedback: blue dashed outlines, blue resize handles, orange rotation handles, selection box with translucent fill
  - Cursor changes: appropriate resize cursors (nw-resize, e-resize, etc.), move cursor, and crosshair for rotation
- [x] Select Tool: move, resize, and rotate items; multi-select with bounding outline
  - Drag inside selection to move; 8 corner/side handles to resize; rotate via rotation handles around object/group bounds; bounding outline drawn around selection
  - Grid snapping and fairway-bounds clamping on move/resize/rotate; min size = 1 grid step; no negative sizes
  - Applies to rect items (walls/bridges/water/sand/hills); Posts: resize radius; Tee/Cup: move-only; multi-select transforms apply to all selected; rotation restricted to rect-like items; polygons translate-only and hide rotation handles when included in selection
- [x] Undo/Redo in Level Editor
  - Placement: Editor Tools menu with dynamic labels showing availability
  - Shortcuts: Ctrl+Z (Undo), Ctrl+Y (Redo), Shift+Ctrl+Z (alternative Redo)
  - State management: 50-step undo stack with automatic snapshots on all placement, deletion, movement, resize, and rotation operations
  - UI feedback: toast messages showing undo/redo descriptions; menu labels update dynamically
- [x] Clipboard: Copy/Cut/Paste selected objects in Level Editor
  - Shortcuts: Ctrl+C (Copy), Ctrl+X (Cut), Ctrl+V (Paste)
  - Supports: rects (walls/water/sand/bridges/hills), posts (radius preserved), polygons (translate-only)
  - Paste behavior: place at mouse cursor with grid snapping and fairway clamping; maintain relative offsets for group selections
  - Cross-level: allow pasting into another level within the same editor session
- [x] Import: Proper Import flow to complement Export
  - UI: in-game overlay with file picker and list (supports multi-select); clear source labels [FS]/[User]
  - Validation: full schema validation with readable error reporting; automatic fix-ups where safe
  - Metadata: set/confirm authorName/authorId and lastModified; title prompt with conflict resolution (rename/overwrite/cancel)
  - Sources: filesystem (File System Access API) and browser builds (file upload)
- [x] Course Select: add "User Made Levels" category; list Title — Author; Play; owner/admin Edit/Delete; permissions gating; no regression
- [x] Level Editor file system integration
  - [x] Load any level from existing `levels/*.json` directory for editing
  - [x] Save levels to filesystem via File System Access API or download fallback
  - [x] User_Levels/<Username>/ directory structure with automatic subdirectory creation
  - [x] Export functionality for browser-only builds (download JSON)
  - [x] Import level from file upload when no saved levels found
  - [x] Combined level picker showing [bundled], [user], [localStorage] source labels
  - [x] Level validation and automatic metadata (author, lastModified) on save/export
  - [x] Combined level listing: shows both localStorage and filesystem levels with [LS]/[FS] labels
  - [x] Directory structure: `User_Levels/Username/Level.json` option for user-created levels
  - [x] Load existing `levels/*.json` files for editing and re-saving
  - [x] Schema validation on load/save operations with detailed error reporting
  - [x] Fixed "No saved levels found" by scanning both localStorage and filesystem levels
  - [x] Three save options: LocalStorage, Filesystem (direct), User Directory (User_Levels/Username/)
  - [x] Filesystem cache with invalidation for performance
  - [x] Comprehensive level schema validation (canvas, tee, cup, walls, posts, arrays, etc.)
- [x] Replace browser dialogs with in-game UI (menus/popups) for a smoother experience
  - Completed: Level Editor (Save, Save As, Load, New, Delete) and Users Admin UI now use in-game overlays (`showUiToast`, `showUiConfirm`, `showUiPrompt`, `showUiList`), fully async with keyboard (Enter/Esc/Arrows)
  - Removed LocalStorage option from Save As; only Filesystem and `User_Levels/<Username>/` supported per policy
  - All previous `alert()/prompt()/confirm()` call sites in `src/main.ts` migrated to overlays
  - Rendering integration: Overlays and toasts are now drawn at the end of `draw()` so they appear above all UI layers; `overlayHotspots` rebuilt each frame while overlays are active; overlay mouse clicks are swallowed to prevent click-through; toasts render as a top-right stack with auto-expire.
  - Fix: Added inline `renderGlobalOverlays()` calls in `draw()` for `course`, `options`, and `changelog` states, so overlays render on these screens too.
- [x] Tool palette: Tee, Cup, Walls/WallsPoly, Posts, Bridges, Water/WaterPoly, Sand/SandPoly, Hills, decorations (full authoring behaviors)
- [x] Metadata editor for level title and author (persist in JSON)
- [x] Par/Birdie suggestion engine based on path analysis and bank heuristics

## User System — Completed
- [x] Local profiles: create/select active user; persist name and role (admin/user)
- [x] Roles & permissions: Admin can edit/delete any level; Normal users can edit/delete their own and duplicate others
  - [x] Verify current enforcement across Save/Delete flows and any editor entry points
  - [x] Add clear UI messaging when an action is blocked due to permissions
  - [x] Add unit tests for permission rules (UsersStore invariants: last-admin safeguards, enable/disable, promote/demote, import/export, init fallbacks)
- [x] Admin-only role management UI (no toggle on Main Menu)
  - Access: Press Shift+F after clicking Start (from Select Course and onward). Options button removed.
  - Admin-only Role Management UI:
    - Add/Remove Users
    - Promote/Demote Users (toggle role user ⇄ admin)
    - Safeguards: cannot remove the last remaining admin; confirm destructive actions; prevent self-demotion when last admin.
  - Default Admin bootstrap (first run): seed a built-in `admin` account with role `admin` so an admin can create another user and promote them. After another admin exists, the built-in `admin` can be disabled.
  - Persistence: Firebase Realtime Database for users and roles
    - Source of truth: Firebase Realtime Database with real-time synchronization
    - Admin UI provides Import/Export JSON functionality for backup/restore
    - No passwords/auth yet (MVP): "login" = selecting an existing user as active profile
  - [optional] Better UI feedback: Replace alert/prompt/confirm with inline messages/snackbar for a smoother admin experience.
- [x] Level ownership: store `meta.authorId`/`meta.authorName` in level JSON; enforce Save/Delete permissions; enable Save a Copy for non-owners
- [x] Scores by user: record per-level and per-course scores keyed by active user; show best for current user (optional all-users view)
- [x] Main Menu: username input field placed above Start and below the graphic; Start disabled until a non-empty username is entered; persist/prefill last user
- [x] Start is blocked when the entered username matches a disabled user (disabled users cannot proceed past Main Menu)
- [x] Disabled-user hint under username input (“User is disabled. Ask an admin to re-enable or select a new name.”)

## Soon (Completed items)
- [x] Water tiles: splash SFX → +1 stroke → reset to pre-shot location
  - [x] Visual ripple and SFX on water contact
- [x] Post-Hole banner with classic golf terms
  - [x] Basic label (Eagle/Birdie/Par/Bogey/Over) with color tint
  - [x] Extended mapping: Condor (-4), Albatross (-3), Eagle (-2), Birdie (-1), Par (0), Bogey (+1), Double Bogey (+2), Triple Bogey (+3); 4+ over shows numeric "n Over"
- [x] Bank-shot dev harness (dev-only path preview) — toggle with `B` (dev builds only)
- [x] Palette extraction to `docs/PALETTE.md`; applied flat fills + clear outlines for water/sand (rects: 1.5px inset; polys: 2px stroke)
 - [x] Options: basic SFX volume and mute controls
- [x] 2025-08-24: Fixed cross-browser level access issue by implementing automatic level migration when user ID changes during Firebase synchronization

## Done (Historical)
- [x] 2025-08-25 — User Made Levels UI: mouse click support and redesign
  - Added full mouse click support for list items and action buttons (Play/Edit/Delete/Duplicate)
  - Redesigned entries with card-style layout, color-coded source badges, permission hints, and modern scrollbar
  - Updated hit detection to match new button layout and positions
- [x] 2025-08-25 — Level Editor Decorations fix
  - Corrected placement schema for decorations to use `kind` (not `type`) and include `w`/`h` dimensions
  - Added missing `defaultRadius` variable to resolve TypeScript errors
  - Verified decorations (Flowers/Trees/Rocks/Bushes) place and render correctly
- [x] 2025-08-25 — User level visibility for normal users (discover all user-made levels). Kept edit/delete gated by owner/admin checks. Removed obsolete migrations from `src/main.ts` and `src/firebase/index.ts`.
- [x] 2025-08-25 — Fixed Firebase level deletion using proper Firebase ID
  - `src/editor/levelEditor.ts`: Load picker now stores the true Firebase ID (`entry.name`) separately from the UI label. `openDeletePicker()` uses this ID when calling `firebaseManager.levels.deleteLevel()`.
  - Verified `src/main.ts` delete flow already resolves a `LevelEntry` and passes `levelToDelete.name` (the Firebase ID), so no change was necessary there.
- [x] Fix: Resolved TypeScript errors in `src/main.ts` — verified `loadLevel`, `loadLevelByIndex`, `preloadLevelByIndex` implementations near file end; added explicit `unknown` type to a caught error parameter to satisfy strict TS.
  - [x] Closed missing closing brace in `draw()`; `npx tsc --noEmit` is clean.
- [x] Fix: Converted `scripts/cleanup-db.js` to ESM `import` to match `package.json` ("type": "module"). This resolves the Node v22 `require()` error when running `npm run cleanup:db`.
- [x] Fix: Updated all Firebase TypeScript modules with `.js` extensions for Node.js ESM compatibility; created store instances in `index.ts`; fixed import/export conflicts.
- [x] Create `TODO.md` with phase-structured checklist
- [x] Consolidate video findings into a single section
- [x] Record stack recommendation matching early-2000s simplicity
- [x] Scaffold project (TS + Vite + Canvas)
- [x] Fixed canvas 960×600 + letterbox (visual proportions closer to reference)
- [x] Aim–drag–release loop; friction; input lock while moving
 - [x] Polygon walls: rendering + collision via segment edges (diagonals/triangles)
- [x] Level design pass: adjusted `levels/level4.json`–`level6.json` for logical cup/obstacle placement; ensured `level8` polygon water renders visibly.
- [x] Dev-only bank-shot preview toggle fixed: robust dev detection (`isDevBuild()`), canvas focus during drag, broader dev key listeners; DEV watermark/badge and diagnostics for verification.
- [x] Main Menu → Level Editor: await Firebase user synchronization before initializing editor; removed duplicated block and closed missing brace in `src/main.ts`. TypeScript build (`tsconfig.build.json`) is clean.
- [x] Main Menu: username input focus UX — blinking caret, placeholder hides during edit, I-beam cursor while editing; thicker focus border; input nudged down to avoid clipping.
- [x] HUD: show active user's name on the top-left; push `Hole x/y` label right to make room.
- [x] User System: removed Main Menu role toggle; roles will be managed by Admin-only controls (upcoming). Role still persists to localStorage for permissions.
- [x] User System: level ownership metadata (authorId/authorName) added to Level schema; per-user score tracking with best scores shown in HUD.
- [x] Docs: CHANGELOG structure restored (Unreleased on top); version 0.3.23 recorded
- [x] Fix (2025-08-24): Level Editor loading did not apply saved canvas dimensions. Updated `loadEditorLevelIntoGlobals()` in `src/editor/levelEditor.ts` to set `levelCanvas.width/height` from level data. Verified via build; recorded in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- [x] Admin visibility (2025-08-24): Admins can view all users' levels (public + private) across Level Editor and Course Select. Wired in `src/main.ts` to pass `undefined` as `userId` for admins to `firebaseManager.levels.getAllLevels()`.
- [x] Fix: TypeScript config — removed invalid `"vitest/globals"` type from `tsconfig.json` to clear IDE TS error; tests import Vitest APIs directly.
